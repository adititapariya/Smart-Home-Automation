Automation is a term for technology applications where human input is minimized. It
describes the wide range of technologies that reduce human intervention in process. Time is
a very valuable thing. Everybody wants to save time as much as they can. New technologies
are being introduced to save our time. Recently the popularity of controlling electrical
devices through phones has been increasing due to high performance and reduced work by
connection through smartphones which is helpful for elderly and physically handicapped
persons. So, they can access the appliances without the help of others.

The fan, as a common appliance, has enjoyed the smart automation. This can be achieved
through Bluetooth, a widespread wireless technology used for sharing data, available in
android smartphones. Controlling a fan using a smart android device via wireless Bluetooth
microcontroller was made possible with the use of a simple Bluetooth mobile application
that sends signals from the mobile phone to the microcontroller. The system introduces an
android OS based application for smartphones that communicates with the fan through
mobile devices continuously to control the fan speed. Thus, the system will enable the user
to have a control over the speed of the fan in his or her home with Bluetooth.
